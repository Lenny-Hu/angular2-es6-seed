# Angular2 ES6 seed

A simple seed project to demonstrate bootstrapping of Angular2 using ES6 (The
Sixth Edition of JavaScript, known as ES6 or ECMAScript 2015). The project uses
(among other things):

- [ES6](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/ECMA-262.pdf) +
[Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel)
- [Angular 2 (v2.0.1)](https://github.com/angular/angular)
- [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) +
[Babelify](https://github.com/babel/babelify)
- [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [Karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma)
- [Jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine)
- [Gulp (v2)](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp)
- [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v6.7.0 [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Initial setup

From the root directory of this project, run the following commands:

```
npm install -g gulp
npm install
```

## Updating when package.json changes

All JavaScript dependencies of the project are specified in the file
`package.json` in the root folder. If this file is updated (new dependency is
added, or something is removed), you have to run the command:

```
npm install
```

to make sure you have all the latest dependencies (the folder `node_modules`
will be updated by this command).

## Running the application

### Build

Initially, you will not have the folder `dist`. This folder will contain the
built web application from the sources. To build the application, you need
to run the command:

```
gulp dist
```

### Simple HTTP server

To run a simple HTTP server (that will serve the built static site, contained
in folder `dist`), in a separate console window run:

```
gulp start
```

### Ease of development

To continuously re-build the project when you change some files, in a separate
console window run:

```
gulp watch
```

### JavaScript unit tests

To run JavaScript unit tests, in a separate console window run:

```
gulp test
```

This command can be further tailored for your needs. Available variations:

```
gulp test --once
gulp test --browser chrome
gulp test --browser phantomjs
gulp test --browser chrome --once
...
```

NOTE: The order of parameters to `gulp test` does not matter.

### Coverage

To gather coverage status (percent of JavaScript code covered by JS unit tests),
in a separate console window run:

```
gulp coverage
```

NOTE: Make sure that the simple HTTP server is running and is serving the
application.

### Linting JS code

To run ESLint (will check ES6 JavaScript code), you need to run the following
command:

```
gulp lint
```

## Influences

This POC was inspired by
[Angular 2 + ES6 + SASS](https://github.com/select/Angular2-ES6-Babel-Browserify-Starter)
project. That project is quite old - it uses the beta Angular 2 sources. Also
that project doesn't work right now.
